# Arduino-Based-Quadcopter
This project was a team project achieved along with members of STIC( Student Technical Innovation Club) at Medicaps University

The specialty about this quad copter was that it was based on an arduino microcontroller for the purpose of flight control. We designed this quad copter from ground zero along with its mechanical structure, electrical schematic design & connections and also calibrated it for stable flight
